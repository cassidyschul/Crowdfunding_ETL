# Extract, Transform, and Load Project 
A python script was created to build an ETL pipeline

Data was extracted into Pandas dataframes, the data was transformed using Python dictionary methods, and saved into csv files in the Resources folder.

The csv data files were used to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. 


The data was then uploaded into a Postgres database.
